# Makefile for packaging and testing pytest_pgsql
#
# This Makefile has the following targets:
#
# pyenv - Sets up pyenv and a virtualenv that is automatically used
# deactivate_pyenv - Deactivates the pyenv setup
# dependencies - Installs all dependencies for a project (including mac dependencies)
# setup - Sets up the entire development environment (pyenv and dependencies)
# clean_docs - Clean the documentation folder
# clean - Clean any generated files (including documentation)
# open_docs - Open any docs generated with "make docs"
# docs - Generated sphinx docs
# validate - Run code validation
# test - Run tests
# run - Run any services for local development (databases, CSS compiliation, airflow, etc)
# version - Show the version of the package
